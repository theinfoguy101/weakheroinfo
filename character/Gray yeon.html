<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In class and outside of school, Gray appears as the model high school student: quiet, diligent, and hardworking. He is very responsible as a student and follows instructions to the letter, listening to any instructions given to him. <br><br>However, underneath this façade of a model student is a certain emptiness, which Gray felt especially clearly during his time in Byuksan. He had no clear goal for which to reach at, all he did was blindly follow what others would tell him, without regard as to his own opinions.[3] Gray's emptiness would eventually be filled by his friendship with Stephen Ahn, who became Gray's best friend and allowed Gray to open himself up to other people.[4] Following Stephen's hospitalization however, Gray suffered from a deep depression before undergoing a massive personality change, becoming the person he is in the series <br><br>Cool, logical, and cunning, the current Gray Yeon is not afraid to speak up or move to action should things get violent.

Gray has also proven himself to be extremely patient and aware of his situation and surroundings, willing to bear multiple provocations from Teddy Jin to bide his time for revenge.[7] However, he still has a tendency to become reckless should the heat of the moment overtake him. For example, picking a fight with five Yoosun High students in the underpass before Gerard Jin, Ben Park, and Alex Go intervened.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gray Yeon attended Byuksan Middle School prior to the beginning of the series. In that time period, he was consistently the best in his class and at the top of his entire grade.[3] Gray would frequently study many subjects because of his belief that if he knew enough, he could dispel the feeling of emptiness he felt. Later on, he would go on to befriend Stephen Ahn and eventually Bryce Oh <br><br> However, following Bryce's descent into delinquency, Gray and Stephen were frequently bullied by their other classmates.[9][10][11] This bullying eventually culminated in an incident that would comatose Stephen, which sent Gray into a deep depression. Shortly after the incident, Gray would skip school for two months in order to undergo physical training and to plan his revenge against Bryce and the others <br><br> After he had taken revenge, Gray was expelled for assaulting said students, among which one was the son of the city representative Oscar Yang.[13] After the expulsion, he had problems being accepted into local high schools because of the incident, but due to the efforts of Mrs. Lee, a teacher in Byuksan, he was eventually enrolled in Eunjang.</p>
