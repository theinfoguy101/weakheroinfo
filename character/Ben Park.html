His carefree attitude extends to his leadership of his class, which is indisputably the leader of. Unlike other classes of Eunjang, Ben's class has a relaxed atmosphere, with the classmates demonstrating friendliness and loyalty towards each other. In the background, they can be seen playing sports together and goofing off. He has also been shown in the past to have a love for pranking his friends with some harmless tricks, such as attaching a large paper ‘N’ to the back of Gerard Jin’s head to make it resemble the icon of Naver. <br><br> Ben also shows immense commitment and regard to a physical routine, as shown when he performs 50 pull-ups in a row as part of his gym workout and Alex's frequent comments on his fixation with working out. <br><br> When fighting, while Ben is usually shown not holding back, he is not overtly cruel or ruthless like other characters within the series.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Ben was still in Eunjang Middle School, he fought Jimmy Bae in a skirmish involving his best friend Alex Go. While it seemed they were evenly matched, Ben started to gain the upper hand in their fight until Donald Na arrived and interrupted their fight. When Ben challenged Donald, the head of the Yeongdeungpo Union easily pummeled Ben until he was barely conscious, and Ben survived only by coincidence when Donald received a phone call at the last minute. After the fight with Donald, Ben severely injured his arm; because of that, he required extensive treatment as well as physical therapy to make a full recovery. As a result, he spent a majority of his time after the fight and before the beginning of the series avoiding conflict and pursuing a peaceful lifestyle. <br><br> </p>
